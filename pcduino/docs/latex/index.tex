This program collects data from the hardware sensors, then converts it to a readable unit (Celcius, etc), and uploads it to a server.

We only need one python file to accomplish this, and that file is \hyperlink{sensing_8py}{sensing.\-py}. This single file depends on the pypcduino library however, and that code is also included.

The appropriate documentation is included within.\hypertarget{index_authors}{}\section{Authors}\label{index_authors}

This python script runs on several pc\-Duino v2 boards located in different places. Each unit has various sensors attached to it, and for whatever sensor they have, the appropriate data is uploaded.\hypertarget{index_serverinfo}{}\section{Server Information}\label{index_serverinfo}
The server is a Ubuntu instance on Amazon's E\-C2 infrastructure. The server runs Mongo\-D\-B and listens for input through a R\-E\-S\-T A\-P\-I generated by a Dream\-Factory instance. The server also utilizes Angular.\-J\-S and\-Node.\-J\-S to create a graphical frontend for the information.\hypertarget{index_requirements}{}\section{Requirements to Run}\label{index_requirements}
This code requires the external library 'requests'.
