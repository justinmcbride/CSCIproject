\section information Information
This program collects data from the hardware sensors, then converts it to a readable unit (Celcius, etc), and uploads it to a server.

We only need one python file to accomplish this, and that file is sensing.py. This single file depends on the pypcduino library however, and that code is also included.

The appropriate documentation is included within.

\section hardwareinfo Hardware Information
This python script runs on several pcDuino v2 boards located in different places.
Each unit has various sensors attached to it, and for whatever sensor they have, the appropriate data is uploaded.

\section serverinfo Server Information
The server is a Ubuntu instance on Amazon's EC2 infrastructure. The server runs MongoDB and listens for input through a REST API generated by a DreamFactory instance. The server also utilizes Angular.JS andNode.JS to create a graphical frontend for the information.
