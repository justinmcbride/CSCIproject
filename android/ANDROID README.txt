These files are used to generate an android app that will read raw data from the mongodb server by queriring
our rest interface and display the data in a simple text box. Work on the android application began once all
other deliverables on the project were completed so the app still needs development.

Most of the files here were generated automatically by the Android Eclipse IDE. Files that contain comments are

/app/java/MainActivity.java			executes startup tasks
/app/java/RequestTask.java			quieries REST interface for raw data
/app/java/MainFragment.java			updates user interface with new data
/app/res/layout/activity_main.xml		describes layout of the user interface
/app/res/layout/anroid_manifest.xml		provides more info for user interface

These files will explain how the app works and which function it uses.
